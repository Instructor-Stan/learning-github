                <li>Type "git clone git@github.com:StanCrump/learning-github.git" to clone this repository. The clone command can be found on the web 
                    under the "Code" button in the repository you want to clone.</li>
                <li>Type "cd &lt;directory&gt; where directory is the part of the name you cloned between the last slash (/) and ".git" on the end. Ex. learning-github</li>

                <li>Type "code ." to start VS Code editor and open the directory you just cloned. (Now change some code. I created a new file "index.html")</li>
